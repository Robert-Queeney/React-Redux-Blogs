# React-Redux-Blogs

This was a tutorial I worked through as I improve my Redux knowledge.  I specifically learned how to access state through the mapStateToProps method that will then get passed into the connect function.  Additionally, I became more familiar with some of the initial boilerplating that has to happen in order for Redux to work.  

Once that is implemented, it becomes much easier to access and manage state.
